# oakd_camera
Python code to setup and run a neural network on the OAK-D Camera and an OpenCV window with detection ROIs on the image. Code was developed and tested in PyCharm.

# Camera
Code for OAK-D camera from Luxonis.  
Robotics Vision Core 2 (RVC2) with 16x SHAVE cores  
 -> Streaming Hybrid Architecture Vector Engine (SHAVE)  
Color camera sensor = 12MP (4032x3040 via ISP stream)  
Depth perception: baseline of 7.5cm  
 -> Ideal range: 70cm - 8m  
 -> MinZ: ~20cm (400P, extended), ~35cm (400P OR 800P, extended), ~70cm (800P)  
 -> MaxZ: ~15 meters with a variance of 10% (depth accuracy evaluation)
